## See the contents of any site

**Scepter** has a easy UI to help you understand how a site is built, fix problems, or make tweaks.

## Just type a URL

Combining the power of both **iframes** and **CORS requests**, you can just type a URL to inspect it.

## Mobile first

There's no reason to have to open the computer just to inspect. Tap and swipe to roam the site.
